It is here that Krishna’s magical days of childhood were spent and his powers came to be recognised. Balagokulam nurtures children to discover and manifest that divinity. Balagokulam will enable Hindu children to appreciate their cultural roots, learn values in an enjoyable manner and make good friends.";
